<!--<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>Welcome to your new single-page application, built with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
    <li><a href='https://angular.io/'>Angular</a> and <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript</a> for client-side code</li>
    <li><a href='https://webpack.github.io/'>Webpack</a> for building and bundling client-side resources</li>
    <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for layout and styling</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you get started, we've also set up:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-side prerendering</strong>. For faster initial loading and improved SEO, your Angular app is prerendered on the server. The resulting HTML is then transferred to the browser where a client-side copy of the app takes over.</li>
    <li><strong>Webpack dev middleware</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run the <code>webpack</code> build tool. Your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand. Updates are available as soon as you modify any file.</li>
    <li><strong>Hot module replacement</strong>. In development mode, you don't even need to reload the page after making most changes. Within seconds of saving changes to files, your Angular app will be rebuilt and a new instance injected is into the page.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and the <code>webpack</code> build tool produces minified static CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>-->

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I've built this very simple Angular 4 application to get some practice using Angular 4, typescript and to demonstrate the use of an api.</p>
<p>This tiny little project relies upon an open api provided by NASA that delivers its <a href="/nasa"><strong>A</strong>stronomy <strong>P</strong>hoto <strong>O</strong>f the <strong>D</strong>ay</a>. 
    You can learn more about the open api's that NASA provides <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Given that I am hosting this very simple app on Github Pages, I have opted not to include my own NASA api key here and have instead used the default key provided by NASA.  
   Using this key comes with some restrictions, specifically 30 requests per IP address per hour and 50 requests per IP address per day.</p>
<p>If you are not getting an example of the NASA APOD on the second link to the right, these restrictions may be causing the issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my very simple Angular 4 app!</p>

<!-- Place this tag where you want the button to render. -->
<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/kltft" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Follow @kltft on GitHub">Follow @kltft</a>
<!-- Place this tag in your head or just before your close body tag. 
    For my Angular 4 app I placed this tag into Index.cshtml.
    I've included it here though for my future reference.
